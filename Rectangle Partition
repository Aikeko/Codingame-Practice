# https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/rectangle-partition

# There is a rectangle of given width w and height h,

# On the width side, you are given a list of measurements.
# On the height side, you are given another list of measurements.

# Draw perpendicular lines from the measurements to partition the rectangle into smaller rectangles.

# In all sub-rectangles (include the combinations of smaller rectangles), how many of them are squares?


# Example

# w = 10
# h = 5
# measurements on x-axis: 2, 5
# measurements on y-axis: 3

#    ___2______5__________ 
#   |   |      |          |
#   |   |      |          |
#  3|___|______|__________|
#   |   |      |          |
#   |___|______|__________|

# Number of squares in sub-rectangles = 4 (one 2x2, one 3x3, two 5x5)
