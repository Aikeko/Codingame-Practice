# Your objective is to write a program that will compute, for each cell of a maze, the number of times Pikaptcha will step into the cell by following a wall until he reaches his original location.
# wall-following
# Left wall following
#  	Rules
# The maze is given to you as a grid filled with 0s and #s, where 0 represents a passage, and # represents a wall: an impassable cell.
# The initial position and direction of Pikaptcha is given to you in the grid as a special character:
# >: facing right
# v: facing down
# <: facing left
# ^: facing up
# An additional character indicates which wall Pikaptcha must follow:
# R for the wall on his right
# L for the wall on his left
# Weâ€™re considering the 4-adjacency, meaning a cell has a maximum of 4 adjacent cells (a diagonal cell is not adjacent).

# You must analyze the given maze and return it with a small transformation: for each empty cell, instead of a 0, you must return the number of times Pikaptcha stepped into that cell while striding along the maze, following a wall. For each impassable cell, you change nothing: you still return #.
